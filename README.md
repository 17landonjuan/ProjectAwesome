# ProjectAwesome

Our basic idea is to create an application that will allow users to plan out a road trip with friends. Additionally the user will be able to input their vehicle information which will then calculate an estimated sum cost for the amount of gasoline needed for the trip, based on the total distance they want to travel, their car's average MPG, and an overall national average price for a gallon of gas. With that total trip cost estimate we also allow the user to enter in the number of persons accompanying him or her to then divide the trip cost evenly among the group.
